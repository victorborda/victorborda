## def about(me): ðŸ‘‹

As a Director and Senior Director for engineering and data science, I have a lot of experience leading teams on software projects. My thoughts on engineering organization ethos and practical application of good software strategies is encapsulated here:
- [Software Development Guide - my thoughts on positive software development practices](https://github.com/victorborda/software-dev-guide)

As a software architect and coder, which I also love doing, currently (Fall 2024) I'm primarily working with:
- Python, Django, Typescript, React.js, React Native
- PostgreSQL, PostGIS
- PyTorch, Flyte, Helm, Airflow
- AWS AppRunner, EC2, RDS, VPC, IAM, Route53
- Docker, Kubernetes (k8s), Orbstack, EKS, EC2

Pretty much always interested in Open Street Map and Geospatial data. Thus, also working with
- PostGIS extensions, TIGER/Line, Osm2psql, PgOsmFlex, GDAL, MapLibre.js

I have several publicly available docker images for folks to use. Two of them are:
- [PostgresSQL running PostGIS and related extensions for OSM, Geocoding, and Routing](https://hub.docker.com/r/therapeuticyoga/postgis-osm-geo-route-amd)
- [Python with GDAL, OpenCV, Rasterio, PyTorch and Jupyter for geo focused data science](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/therapeuticyoga/opencv-rasterio-jupyter-amd/general)

I love a good research paper. I've also co-authored a number of patents:
- [Interesting Papers - a collection of papers that I think are really interesting, mostly with an algorithm or ML focus](https://github.com/victorborda/interesting-papers)
- [Patents - that I've been a part of](https://github.com/victorborda/patents)

Other skills, things I've architected or dev'd with in production scenarios:
- C++, Swift, iOS, RabbitMQ, Kafka, FastAPI

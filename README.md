## def about(me): ðŸ‘‹

As an AI Architect, I work at the intersection of structured and unstructured data, data science, infrastructure, and product vision - I help make effective AI a reality.

I have a lot of experience leading teams on software projects. My thoughts on engineering organization ethos and practical application of good software strategies is encapsulated here:
- [Software Development Guide - my thoughts on positive software development practices](https://github.com/victorborda/software-dev-guide)

As a software architect and coder, on my own projects I primarily work with:
- Python, Django, Typescript, React.js, React Native
- PostgreSQL, PostGIS
- PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, XArray
- AWS AppRunner, RDS, SQS, Lambda, VPC, IAM, Route53, ECR, EC2
- Docker, Dockerhub, Kubernetes (k8s), Orbstack

As an enthusiast, I love working with Open Street Map and Geospatial data, such as:
- PostGIS extensions, TIGER/Line, Osm2psql, PgOsmFlex, GDAL, MapLibre.js

I love a good research paper. I've also co-authored a number of patents:
- [Interesting Papers - a collection of papers that I think are really interesting, mostly with an algorithm or ML focus](https://github.com/victorborda/interesting-papers)
- [Patents - that I've been a part of, including AI & ML](https://github.com/victorborda/patents)
